This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 where routes may not render correctly due to incorrect nesting or path configurations within the `Routes` component.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of the problem, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct implementation.  The issue often stems from misplacing the `<Routes>` component, failing to provide correct paths, or improperly nesting routes leading to unexpected path matching behavior.  This can manifest in several ways, including pages not rendering at all or the wrong page rendering in response to a navigation action.
